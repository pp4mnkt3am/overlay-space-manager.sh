# overlay-space-manager.sh

TESTING. 

Overlay Space Manager is a utility for EasyOS that helps users  avoid Runing out of writable overlay space, even when plenty of disk space exists elsewhere.  In EasyOS, the writable system layer (/, including /root) is limited in size and lives inside an overlay filesystem (often backed by RAM/zram or a save layer).


Everybody is welcome to collaborate.
